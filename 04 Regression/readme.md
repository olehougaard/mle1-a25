## Session 2: Linear Regression

The files in this folder are the companion files to session 2: Linear Regression.

The .csv files contain the data and are maybe not that interesting.

There are two .ipynb files:

1. visualizations.ipynb: This is the code I use to copy/paste to the slides. It's probably a bit messy and not well-explained.
2. example.ipynb: An example of linear regression using the Hitters data set. It doesn't go well, but it shows the models.
